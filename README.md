In the age of early digital type, several methods were explored to draw letterforms. One of them, the Bézier spline, an algorithm that generates curves with a small quantity of data, has the crucial advantage of sparing computer memory and processing resources. As a result, drawing type with Bézier curves became the industry standard, and remains so today. This project aims to question and reevaluate this standard, to move beyond established trends, and to develop innovative, liberating ideas by exploring alternative methods of drawing curves and letterforms.

Beyond Bézier is a research project with contributions by Matthieu Cortat-Roller, Alice Savoie, Kai Bernau, Radim Peško, Micha Wasem and Florence Yerly. The project started in September 2023 and was completed in May 2025. Raphaela Haefliger and Roland Früh were responsible for coordination and Nicolas Bernklau for design.

The research project has been jointly organised by ECAL (University of Art and Design Lausanne) and HEIA-FR (Haute école d’ingénierie et d’architecture de Fribourg) and has been supported by HES-SO, Réseau de Compétences Design et Arts Visuels.
